## TreasureCorp's Unique Value Proposition

### Core Differentiators:
1. **Only platform combining**: Multi-chain + Governance + Treasury + Simulation
2. **Comprehensive governance**: Voter AND proposal tracking (vs. competitors with limited governance)
3. **Actionable insights**: Real-time reports + downloadable data for decision-making
4. **Strategic planning**: Simulation + scenario modeling for treasury management

### Competitive Advantages:

**vs. Analytics Platforms (Dune, Messari):**
- Pre-built DAO-specific dashboards vs. custom queries required
- Governance integration vs. general market data
- Treasury-focused insights vs. broad crypto analytics

**vs. Intelligence Tools (Nansen, Arkham):**
- Governance and operational focus vs. trading/investigation focus
- DAO treasury management vs. wallet tracking
- Scenario planning vs. historical analysis

**vs. Treasury Services (Karpatkey):**
- Self-service platform vs. managed service
- Technology solution vs. service provider
- Accessible pricing vs. high AUM requirements

**vs. DeepDAO:**
- Real-time operational insights vs. static research data
- Multi-chain treasury aggregation vs. limited cross-chain
- Scenario modeling vs. basic reporting

## Pricing Strategy

### Market Pricing Analysis:

**Market Segments:**

- **Enterprise**: $1,299/month (Full features + custom)

### Pricing Justification:

- **ROI for MoonDAO**: $8,388/year vs. $1.2M treasury = 0.7% of AUM
- **Industry Standard**: 0.5-2% of AUM for treasury management services
- **Below Karpatkey**: 1-2% AUM = $12K-24K/year for $1M treasury

- **Year 2 Target**: 50 DAOs at average $800/month = $480K ARR
