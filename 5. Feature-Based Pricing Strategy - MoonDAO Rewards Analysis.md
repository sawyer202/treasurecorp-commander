## MOONDAO REWARDS DATA ANALYSIS

### Current Operational Scale

**Contributor Management:**
- **1,250+ contributor records** managed manually in Excel
- **1,000+ project allocations** tracked across spreadsheets
- **Quarterly reward distributions** requiring extensive manual calculations
- **$100K-500K+ annual rewards** processed through manual workflows

**Process Pain Points:**
- **15-20 hours/month** of treasury analyst time @ $75-100/hour = **$1,125-2,000/month**
- **5-10 hours/month** of developer maintenance @ $150/hour = **$750-1,500/month**
- **High error risk** in $100K+ quarterly distributions
- **Manual cross-chain aggregation** across Ethereum + Arbitrum
- **Delayed insights** for governance decision-making

**Total Hidden Costs:** **$1,875-3,500/month**

### Treasury Scale Indicators

**MoonDAO Treasury Composition:**
- **Ethereum:** ~$870K (primary treasury)
- **Arbitrum:** ~$300K+ (secondary operations)
- **Total:** ~$1.2M across multiple chains

**Pricing Capacity Analysis:**
- DAOs typically allocate **1-3% of treasury** for operational tools
- **$1.2M treasury × 1-3% = $12K-36K annual tool budget**
- **Monthly equivalent:** $1,000-3,000/month sustainable tool spend

### 3. Feature Completeness Drives Willingness to Pay

**Current Coverage Gap:**
- **70-80% feature coverage** at $699/month
- **Missing 20-30% features** represent **60-70% of operational pain**
- **Multi-chain** and **rewards automation** are highest-impact needs
