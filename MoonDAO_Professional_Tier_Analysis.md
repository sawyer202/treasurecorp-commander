## MoonDAO's Current Technology Stack

### **Existing Tools & Processes:**

**Primary Infrastructure:**
- **Gnosis Safe**: Multi-sig wallet infrastructure (Free-$50/month)
- **Google Workspace**: Google Sheets for data processing (~$12-18/user/month)
- **Tableland**: On-chain data storage for governance/rewards (~$0-100/month)
- **Custom Scripts**: Manual data aggregation and reporting (Developer time)
- **Human Resources**: Treasury analyst/coordinator for manual processes

**Treasury Management:**
- **Ethereum Safe**: eth:0xce4a1E86a5c47CD677338f53DA22A91d85cab2c9 (~$870K)

   - No scenario modeling for proposal impacts
   - Limited historical trend analysis

4. **Governance Analytics Gap**
   - No voter participation tracking

5. **Process Inefficiencies**
   - 10-20 hours/month of manual data processing
   - Risk of human error in calculations
   - Delayed insights for decision-making
